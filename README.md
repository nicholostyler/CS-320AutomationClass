<p>It is important for code to be functional and secure, this is because there is a lot that can go wrong in terms of security if code is not used correctly. One way to keep it secure is using automated testing which allows people to see flaws in their code while they push it to a repository. You can also ensure that your program is functional by allowing people to review your code on your team to make sure you have a second set of eyes on the problem.</p>
<p>You can interpret users needs by asking them upfront to put down exactly what they want and make sure they are aware of potential limitations before you begin. This is important because then your team and the client will be on the same page in terms of what the program needs. Secondly, you can make sure the program incorporates what the user needs by making a requirement document that your programmers can look through while they are making features and doing code reviews.</p>
<p>You can approach designing software through a variety of different testing and corporate methods of development. For instance, agile allows for code to be written faster and features to be written in the program in a more streamlined way. You approach this by seeing the timeline that your client wants to code and making sure you are able to acomplish it in that time frame. You also want to design your software to be testable using safe memory and error handling and utilizing test classes such as unit testing.</p>
